# Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline for image classification, focusing on detecting adulterated red chili powder images. The notebook includes image processing, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Key Components

### 1. **Data Handling and Preprocessing**
- Uses Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Loads image data from a specified directory and processes it to extract features for model input.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. **Visualization**
- Visualizes data distribution using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for better understanding and exploration.

### 3. **Modeling**
- Implements multiple models including:
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- Includes deep learning techniques using `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for building an autoencoder model.
- The model architecture consists of encoder and decoder layers to learn compact representations of input images.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Measures model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Provides a detailed analysis of model predictions and potential improvements.

### 5. **Libraries Used**
- `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and other essential Python libraries.
